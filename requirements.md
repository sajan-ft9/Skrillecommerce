<!-- Build an e-commerce web application that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout securely. -->

<!-- The application should have the following features: -->

<!-- User registration and login -->

<!-- A product catalogue that displays products with descriptions, prices, and images -->

<!-- A search function that allows users to find products by name or category -->

<!-- A shopping cart that allows users to add, remove, or update the quantity of items in their cart -->

<!-- A checkout system that allows users to enter their shipping and payment information and complete their purchase -->

<!-- An order history page that allows users to view their previous orders -->

<!-- A product management system that allows administrators to add, edit, or delete products from the catalogue -->

<!-- An inventory management system that tracks the availability of products and updates the catalogue accordingly -->

<!-- A secure payment system that accepts credit card payments and uses encryption to protect sensitive information. -->

<!-- Our expectation is that you create a functional barebone application with the requirements stated above. Please get back to us within 7 days with whatever you have completed.  -->

<!-- Looking forward to your reply. Best of luck.  -->
